    <h1 class="title">Conference About The Awareness of GIS </h1>
    <p class="text">
        The problem is created where we have no idea how to implement & use in the practical life.
        Todays's concern is about awareness of <span style="color: brown;"> GIS</span>.
        GIS is all about earth, changes & its activities. <span style="color: blue;">
            Remote Sensing (RS) </span> helps in analyzing the earth & avoiding ground survey.
        Every big companies first prefer to analyze the upcoming projects by its ground truthing but
        <span style="color: blueviolet;"> RS </span>made it easy through satellite.
        <span style="color: brown;"> GIS</span> creates the right of way before implementing the project &
        after completing the project or during the process that helps in investigating it time to time without
        ground-truthing. This awareness can be spread in Karachi through
        <a href="https://uok.edu.pk/research_institutes/isst/index.php">ISST</a>.

<h1 class="title">GIS Products</h1>
<ul class="title">
    <p class="title">
        <li class="title">ArcGIS is a comprehensive suite of mapping and location intelligence tools and capabilities. ArcGIS can be
            deployed on local machines (ArcGIS Pro), on your remote or on-premises servers (ArcGIS Enterprise), or as
            SaaS hosted by Esri (ArcGIS Online). ArcGIS includes focused apps to deliver complete solutions for your
            business or organization. Along with software, Esri provides a comprehensive collection of data and content
            to geo-enrich your own data. ArcGIS also provides rich software development tools for you to configure and
            create your own mapping and location intelligence products.</li>
        <li>Get advanced business tools in addition to all the easy-to-use features and imagery of Google Earth.</li>
        <li>BatchGeo is the easiest way to get your list of addresses on a map. Since 2006 BatchGeo has hosted millions
            of maps for Fortune 50 companies, non-profits, and individuals. The idea behind BatchGeo is most geographic
            data is stored in some sort of spreadsheet, list, or simple table (ex: Excel, CSV, Google Spreadsheets,
            etc.) So its optimized for those formats, making it super easy to drag in or copy/paste your tabular data
            into a map. Once your data is mapped the real fun begins. Your data points are spread out on an easy to
            navigate Google Map. Data can be color coded by groups or ranges, or even heat mapped. If routing is what
            you are interested in, BatchGeo can give you optimized routes for up to 23 points at a time. This ensures
            you don't waste time when visiting your customers. Finally, if you want to share your map it's easy to do.
            You can choose if your map is to be secured (password protected) or generally available to the public.
            BatchGeo can even be used for a store locator for your website.</li>
        <li>Google Maps API is a mapping platform that includes driving directions, Street View imagery and others.</li>
        <li>Connect people, locations, and data using interactive maps created with ArcGIS Online. Quickly create maps
            by dropping in your spreadsheet and mashing it up with other location data included in ArcGIS Online. Apply
            Smart Mapping styles to make your data visually stunning and use intuitive analysis tools to deliver
            location intelligence. Add valuable context to your data by combining it with Esriâ€™s demographic and
            lifestyle data. Work collaboratively with your colleagues to build maps and apps. Instantly share your maps
            and apps with anyone, anywhere. Thousands of organizations and millions of users have proven ArcGIS Online
            to be a scalable and secure software-as-a-service hosted by Esri.</li>
